			<h2>Sports Massage in Malvern</h2>
			<p>
				Hi! I'm Ian, I've recently qualified as a Level 3 Sports Massage
				Therapist. After 30+ years of working in the packaging industry,
				it's time for a change of direction! I took up running about 9
				years ago and have completed a number of marathons, half
				marathons, mud runs and obstacle course races in that time. I'm
				also a member of The Malvern Joggers, who I've run with for the
				last 5 or 6 years. Still working full time at the moment and
				fitting the Sports Massage in around that, so I'm currently
				available for massage after 17:00 Mon - Thurs, after 12:00 on
				Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday races permitted.
			</p>
